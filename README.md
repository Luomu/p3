# Project Three

This is a **limited** remake of Pioneer 
(http://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer) using component-based 
design.

My main intention here is to learn more about entity/component systems 
(see http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/). The particular entity 
framework is http://github.com/alecthomas/entityx.

The project deadline is the end of 2014.

Large parts of Pioneer's source code are used here, the same license 
conditions apply.
